Prerequisites:
- [earthly](https://earthly.dev/get_earthly)
- [docker](https://docker.com)

In the repo, run the following commands:
```
$ earthly +docker
$ ./run-notebook.sh
```

Use the http://127.0.0.1:8890 address that comes up to access jupyter in your browser.
At this point, you can connect to Tello via wifi and control Tello from a notebook.
